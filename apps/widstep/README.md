# Step counter widget
This is my step counter widget. There are many like it, but this one is mine.
Designed to be as narrow as possible, but still easy to read, by sacrificing accuracy and only showing to the nearest 100 steps (0.1k).
Shows a subtle fill colour in the background for progress to the goal. The goal is picked up from the health tracker settings.
