# Messages Notify

This is a replacement for the default `messages` app. It does one thing: shows incoming messages as a notification. There is no message storage, no music controls, no call controls.

This app does emit events for music and call messages, but does not handle them itself.

For the best experience, also install the `Notifications Overlay` app for nicer notifications.
