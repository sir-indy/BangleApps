# Notification Overlay

Replaces the default `notify` module to instead draw on the screen overlay. This allow whatever the Bangle.js2 was previously doing to continue undisturbed underneath the overlay.

Drag up and down to scroll the notification.
Swipe left or right to dismiss the notification.

# Settings
Choose a font in the settings.
